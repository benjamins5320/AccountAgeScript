# AccountAgeScript
# This is a account age script that you can use in your game. Simply open up mainscript and then copy and paste its contents into a script you create inside of roblox studio. AFter that put the script in ServerScript Service and then you are done. (Remember to make the scrip just a regular script NOT a localscript or a modulescript.)
# DISCLAMER: Loadstring() Must be enabled in studio for this to work.
